**William E. Bentley** is the Distinguished Professor and Chair of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering and a professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at the University of Maryland. Since much of his research focuses on the expression of biologically active proteins and quorum sensing, we have referenced many of his papers within the context of our research. We have also requested W3110 _E. coli_ from his lab. (_Photo taken from UMD faculty website_)

**Steven Graff's** paper, _"A Mathematical Model to Study the Role of the Lsr Intergenic Region in Mediation of Autoinducer-2 Quorum Sensing in_ Escherichia Coli" has been an important modeling reference for our project. After we reached out to him, Steven Graff graciously allowed us to use his models and parameters and has given us invaluable advice for our modeling our project. (_Photo taken from LinkedIn_)

**Amin Zargar's** paper, _"Enhancing Intercellular Coordination: Rewiring Quorum Sensing Networks for Increased Protein Expression through Autonomous Induction"_ significantly helped us guide our project. We were fortunate enough to be able to contact him through Skype and ask him for advice on various aspects of our project.
