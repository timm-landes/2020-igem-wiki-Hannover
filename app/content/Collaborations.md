## Postcard Exchange

This year, [Team DÃ¼esseldorf](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf) held a postcard exchange event for iGEM teams in order to promote synthetic biology within various communities. Each iGEM team that participated designed a different postcard and exchanged their postcard with other participating teams so that every team could receive postcards from all over the world. 

This year, we participated in the event and exchanged postcards with 50 other participating schools! The word cloud on our postcard was generated from the most frequency used words in all 2018 iGEM project descrptions in the shape of the University of Virginia Rotunda, the icon of our university.

## Mid-Atlantic Meetup

We participated in the [Mid-Atlantic Meetup](http://2018.igem.org/Team:UMaryland/meetup) hosted by the University of Maryland iGEM team! We had the opportunity to listen to other teams talk about their project, get feedback about our own project, and start collaborations.

We were fortunate enough to collaborate and mentor [RMHS](http://2018.igem.org/Team:RMHS_Maryland), a high school team who is also working with quorum sensing. Since they are in close collaboration with the University of Maryland, they were able to give us PCT6, which is an integral part of our project. As mentors, we helped RMHS with various aspects of their project, including helping edit their wiki, develop wetlab techniques, design events for human practices, and build a model.
