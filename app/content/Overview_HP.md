# Human Practices Overview

The focus of our Human Practices is to engage our community in synthetic biology and from this, shape our project. Some of our projects include creating a public forum about GMOs,  helping out at a STEM summer camp, and mentoring a high school iGEM team. Learn more about what we've been doing.
