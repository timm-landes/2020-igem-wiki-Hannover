# Wiki Collaboration

## Intro

While developing our wiki, we realized that the media wiki template could be improved upon, as editing was slow and inefficient. We began to think of ways to develop a tool that would make editing our wiki faster and more efficient; thus, the Wiki Build Tool was born. We shared our tool with other teams and began to develop a code base that could be shared and improved upon by the current iGEM community and future iGEM teams. 

## Wiki Build Tool

We wanted to make a tool that would make editing the wiki fast and relatively painless. Our tool automates the uploading of content (HTML, CSS, JS, images, and fonts) to the iGEM wiki with some add ons. With a local version of your wiki on your desktop, you can make changes to your files and immediately see the changes on your browser. We proposed our idea at the [Mid-Atlantic Meetup](http://2018.igem.org/Team:UMaryland/meetup) and many teams were interested in our tool. From the positive reception we received, we decided to continue development of our tool so that it could be used by the iGEM community. After posting on the Collaborations page, we received many emails from teams wanting to use and improve upon our tool, which we were extremely excited about! 

## Webscraper

While the Collaborations page is a great place to start to look for collaborations, we quickly realized that we had difficulty finding other teams whose projects were similar to ours. We made a webscraper that could easily pull information from all 2018 iGEM teams wikis and then find a similar project based on user-inputted keywords. To make it more iGEM-friendly, we also made a GUI for the webscraper, allowing teams to quickly search up information they were looking for. 

## Tutorials

Since iGEM is mainly focused on synthetic biology, we realized that many teams may not have a computer science background, making it difficult to edit and style the wiki in the desired manner. We created several detailed tutorials that cover the basics of coding in the terminal, using the Wiki Build Tool, and using the webscraper.   

## Teams

We would like to thank all the teams who expressed interest in using our tool and helped contribute to the codebase!
