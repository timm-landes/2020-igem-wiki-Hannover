##### "The only thing that motivates this team is hatred, money, and food." -Ryan Taylor    

We are thankful for all the hard work that everyone has contributed throughout the summer! Whether it was through Wetlab, Human Practices, Modeling, or Wiki, it was all vital to the success of our project. We became better friends on the team and made a lot of good memories outside of lab through beach volleyball, potlucks, playing Super Smash Bros, and rock climbing.  

We are the twelve undergraduates of Virginia iGEM and here is our team!


## Advisors

**Keith Kozminski** is our amazing advisor who helps guide our research and keeps us on track for the iGEM Jamboree. From teaching a prepatory iGEM course in the spring to helping us with various aspects of our project, Professor Kozminski's wise words and advice has warmed our hearts.

**Jason Papin** is the modeling advisor for our team. With his help and advice, we have developed several models that have significantly shaped our project. We are thankful for all the advice and encouragement that Professor Papin has given us throughout our research! (_Photo taken from UVA Today_)
